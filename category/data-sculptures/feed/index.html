				<description><![CDATA[Team: Julie, Viki, Wataru The data say that a lot of water is used to produce foods, while the amounts vary by crops, animals, and how foods are processed. We want to tell this story because we rarely have a chance to know this fact. We aim to let hungry goers aware that 1. huge amount of water is used to produce foods, 2. water footprint is different by foods and they can lower it &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/03/22/h2omg-do-you-want-me-to-dump-water-on-your-head/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">H2OMG &#8211; Do you want me to dump water on your head?</span></a>]]></description>
