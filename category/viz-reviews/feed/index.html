Link:  https://www.iafrikan.com/2015/08/13/what-does-data-tell-us-about-refugee-flows-in-africa-and-the-rest-of-the-world/ As one of the most controversial and ongoing topics in the world, refugee and immigrants are important issue in international affairs. The two sets of diagram in the link covered pretty much everything about the issue: population, year, origin country &#8211; asylum country, the trend of population change etc. I will analyse the one &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/17/what-does-data-tell-us-about-refugee-flows-and-what-it-failed-to-tell/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">What Does Data Tell Us About Refugee Flows?

				<description><![CDATA[Data Visualization Review https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/03/are-american-women-really-better-off-215782 The piece I selected is from Politico, “Are American Women really better off?” The article made visualization based on an index that measures women’s public service leadership by country. It highlights certain data from the overall dataset. For instance, the percentage of women in civil service (43.2%), the percentage of women in decision-making civil service (34.4%), and the percentage of women in ministerial positions (16.6%).

				<description><![CDATA[Recently, I visited the Museum of Capitalism exhibit at SMFA. Among the pieces on display, there was an interactive sculpture titled &#8220;The Minimum Wage Machine&#8221;, which invited folks to crank a handle to churn out one penny every four seconds &#8211; or, $9/hour. Since the piece sits in a gallery within a university, I think the audience of this piece might be students, academics, and folks wanting (and able) to seek out art.

				<description><![CDATA[Can statistics learning be intuitive? How can learning experience be more creative? Here is an interactive data storytelling example that I found both accurate and engaging: Seeing Theory. Seeing Theory is an interactive data visualization that makes statistics more accessible. It was built using D3.js, by a group of students from Brown University. By decomposing classic statistics theories to step-by-step playful interactions, Seeing Theory visualizes different statistical events to allow users to better comprehend the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/02/08/can-statistics-learning-be-intuitive/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Can Statistics Learning be Intuitive?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[I found Moovit&#8217;s Global Cities Public Transit Usage Report while looking for public transit statistics to use to market a different transit-related company. Moovit is a transit navigation app &#8212; the data presented here was collected through that app. From this page, you can access the same report in many languages, as well as similar reports that are country-specific. This suggests that Moovit wants to appeal to a global audience.

				<description><![CDATA[Link to data visualization from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU): https://www.aclu.org/infographic-combating-mass-incarceration-facts I picked the linked data visualization about mass incarceration in the United States for a few reasons: first, the topic itself is of interest to me. Secondly, this is an example of a non-profit organization trying to call the attention of the general public to facts that are uncomfortable and at times unbelievable, which presents an interesting challenge to grab their attention and then &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/02/07/mass-incarceration-graphic-from-the-aclu/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Mass Incarceration Graphic from the ACLU</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[I chose to evaluate the Washington Post’s Segregation Map, from May of last year. I recently came across it while reading about housing and segregation, and I thought it was a really fascinating piece. I think the audience is pretty broad, though the premise is that these readers care about racial segregation in the first place: the findings are compelling, but only to those who are paying attention to this issue.

The visualization shows the number of journalists who have died around the world, it uses blue to represent past deaths and red for recent ones. It is also possible to interact with each of the spirals and explore every data point as a story.
