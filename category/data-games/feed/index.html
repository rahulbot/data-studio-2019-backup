				<description><![CDATA[Team: Rubez Chong, Sarah Von Ahn, Ayush Chakravarty The data say that 21% of Atlantans live in low-income neighborhoods with limited access to fresh food. We want to tell this story because these challenges are not receiving enough attention in major Southern urban areas, where the issue is particularly acute. For this project, we used the USDA Food Research Atlas, and restricted to our census tracts of interest (everything within Fulton County).

				<description><![CDATA[Group members: Lilian Eix, Amy Vogel, Shikun Zhu The data say that each and every food is different according to its nutritional makeup. We want to tell this story because each nutrient contributes to one&#8217;s well-being in a different way; though we often think of making food choices based on budgeting calories, a different (and perhaps healthier) attitude to instill in kids is to think of food as fuel to help them accelerate in their &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/30/fuel-for-school/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Fuel for School</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By: Julie Ganeshan, Berlynn Bai, Nora Wu The data says that the majority of college-age students eat less than one serving of fruit and one serving of vegetables each day.  A study at New York University found that the prevalence of obesity almost doubled from the time that the a class year arrives on campus and when it graduates. While the &#8220;Freshman 15&#8221; is a hyperbole, college students gain an average of 12 pounds between &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/30/the-grocery-game/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Grocery Game!</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Fuel Frenzy Tanaya, Melinda, Theresa, Victoria The data say that nutritious eating is complicated&#8211;not all foods are equally nutritious even if they’re just as green&#8211;and many events may influence the choices a person makes when planning their meals for the week. Additionally, the data say that one tenth of MIT students face food insecurity on campus. We wanted to tell this story because most young adults have not needed to independently choose their diets until &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/30/fuel-frenzy/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Fuel Frenzy</span></a>]]></description>

This can help people to learn about how to help fight hunger in their area (city, state, etc.) Our goal: the main objective is to demonstrate the importance and interdependence of SNAP, food banks and charities in fighting food insecurity, and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/29/data-games-snapopoly/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Data Games &#8211; SNAPOPOLY</span></a>]]></description>
