We want to tell this story because more people, especially high school students about to venture out into the real world, deserve to understand food reuse and rescue initiatives better.

Itâ€™s important to understand what visuals, formats, and colors work for them. For instance, using red and blue would signify different political parties whereas we may be wanting to emphasize good and bad. Considering this, we will focus on quick, high level summaries at first, and then dive into the specifics &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/11/food-insecurity-ethnicity-and-snap-in-massachusetts/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Food insecurity, ethnicity, and SNAP in Massachusetts</span></a>]]></description>

The data also say that institutions around Massachusetts produce a significant amount of food waste. Stop&#38;Shop is one of these institutions and their store locations are correlated with food insecurity epicenters. We wanted to tell this story as PR managers at Stop&#38;Shop.

As part of our preparation for the sketch, we read about how health inspectors tend to stick to similar routes, which can create blind spots in the food safety &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/11/a-day-in-the-life-of-health-inspectors/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">A Day in the Life of Health Inspectors</span></a>]]></description>
