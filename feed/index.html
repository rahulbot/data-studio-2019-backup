				<description><![CDATA[Our Data Story Incoming MIT Students have it tough. While classes are hard, so is the sudden independence and decision-making around food. This is particularly true for students on East Campus, many of whom don’t have a meal plan as first years. While nutritious food is, in theory, available and affordable, there are some challenges around making it available and accessible to students. There are a few particular barriers we identified through conversations with undergraduate &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/05/17/dinner-hackers/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Dinner Hackers</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Lily Xie, Berlynn Bai, Nora Wu For our project, we partnered with Lovin’ Spoonfuls to create a series of marketing infographics targeted at potential donors in Whole Foods. We started our project with a 30-minute conversation with Liz Ferguson, the Communications &#38; Marketing Director at Lovin’ Spoonfuls. In addition to giving us context on the challenges the organization faced, Liz also provided us with a fact sheet containing their external facing marketing statistics about cost &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/05/16/people-planet-partnership-methodology/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">People, Planet, Partnership &#8211; Methodology</span></a>]]></description>

In a previous project for the class, we imagined ourselves as representatives from Lovin&#8217; Spoonfuls to create a food waste map game for high schoolers; this time, we wanted to work more directly with the organization to target an audience and goal that was meaningful and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/05/16/people-planet-partnership/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">People, Planet, Partnership</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Fueling Frenzy is a specialized card deck designed for use in a suite of games related to meal planning and nutrition on campus. After hearing about some of the politics around meal plans and food insecurity for undergraduates on campus, we started to think about how reliant students might be on free food and how much of that free food isn’t particularly healthy. Based on a combination of the USDA nutritional database, campus free food &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/05/16/fueling-frenzy-impact/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Fueling Frenzy: Impact</span></a>]]></description>

We want to tell this story because these challenges are not receiving enough attention in major Southern urban areas, where the issue is particularly acute.

We want to tell this story because each nutrient contributes to one&#8217;s well-being in a different way; though we often think of making food choices based on budgeting calories, a different (and perhaps healthier) attitude to instill in kids is to think of food as fuel to help them accelerate in their &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/30/fuel-for-school/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Fuel for School</span></a>]]></description>
