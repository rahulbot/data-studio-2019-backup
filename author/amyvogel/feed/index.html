We want to tell this story because food rescue is an innovative and sustainable way of helping those who are food insecure, and we think this method should be implemented in more cities. Thus, we took on the role of food security advocates in order to educate our target audience &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/03/07/closing-the-food-insecurity-gap/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Closing the Food Insecurity Gap</span></a>]]></description>
