The data we used appears mostly in the cards’ attributes.

				<description><![CDATA[Fueling Frenzy is a specialized card deck designed for use in a suite of games related to meal planning and nutrition on campus. After hearing about some of the politics around meal plans and food insecurity for undergraduates on campus, we started to think about how reliant students might be on free food and how much of that free food isn’t particularly healthy. Based on a combination of the USDA nutritional database, campus free food &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/05/16/fueling-frenzy-impact/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Fueling Frenzy: Impact</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team Members: Kate Soule, Tanaya Srini, Nora Wu Our Audience &#38; Goals: Our sketch mapping tool is focused on helping health inspectors in Massachusetts do their jobs better and more efficiently, given that the budget allotted for food inspections in MA has not increased since FY2015. As part of our preparation for the sketch, we read about how health inspectors tend to stick to similar routes, which can create blind spots in the food safety &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/11/a-day-in-the-life-of-health-inspectors/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">A Day in the Life of Health Inspectors</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By: Lily Xie, Sarah Caso, and Tanaya Srini Our group worked with many of the tables provided in the Food Water Footprint report and eventually settled on using the “virtual water” data to demystify where our water comes from, and how much water we consume beyond typical household uses. The data say that only 5% of the water we consume on a daily basis in the US is related to household uses like drinking water, &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/03/21/where-is-your-water-from/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Where is Your Water From?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Our audience for this teacher-facilitated interactive are middle schoolers in the setting of a nutrition or health class. We chose to target this audience because food insecurity is a newer and more nuanced term than hunger—one that much of the team did not encounter until later on in our educations—but can affect people at any age. Because middle school aged children are beginning to go through puberty, gain autonomy in different realms of their lives &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/03/07/food-for-thought-understanding-food-insecurity-in-middle-school/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Food for Thought: Understanding Food Insecurity in Middle School</span></a>]]></description>

Despite setting screen time goals for all apps Apple identifies as &#8220;social media&#8221; (including, curiously, my calendar and calculator widgets), my usage was up 22% from last week. This prompted me to delete the facebook app from my phone, which sent a push notification to the web version reminding me to re-download the app. The fluidity with which my &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/02/26/a-day-of-data-sunday-february-26/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">A Day of Data: Sunday, February 26</span></a>]]></description>
