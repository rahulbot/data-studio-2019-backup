				<description><![CDATA[Lily Xie, Berlynn Bai, Nora Wu For our project, we partnered with Lovin’ Spoonfuls to create a series of marketing infographics targeted at potential donors in Whole Foods. We started our project with a 30-minute conversation with Liz Ferguson, the Communications &#38; Marketing Director at Lovin’ Spoonfuls. In addition to giving us context on the challenges the organization faced, Liz also provided us with a fact sheet containing their external facing marketing statistics about cost &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/05/16/people-planet-partnership-methodology/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">People, Planet, Partnership &#8211; Methodology</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Lily Xie, Berlynn Bai, Nora Wu In our project, we partnered with Lovin&#8217; Spoonfuls, a food rescue organization based in Brookline, in order to reach and educate new donors. In a previous project for the class, we imagined ourselves as representatives from Lovin&#8217; Spoonfuls to create a food waste map game for high schoolers; this time, we wanted to work more directly with the organization to target an audience and goal that was meaningful and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/05/16/people-planet-partnership/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">People, Planet, Partnership</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Food Rescue: High School Edition Berlynn Bai, Ayush Chakravarty, Lily Xie &#160; The data say that within two miles of one Boston High School in the Fenway area, over 9,000 pounds of food is wasted a day from grocery stores alone. We want to tell this story because more people, especially high school students about to venture out into the real world, deserve to understand food reuse and rescue initiatives better. Our audience is high &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/04/11/rescue-mission/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Rescue Mission</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Roughly chronologically, this past Sunday: My iPhone logs when my alarm went off and how many times I pressed the snooze button. I send conversation data to Apple via iMessage. I also generate data about my location and device usage, which is possibly anonymized and sold/distributed to third parties. I adjust the temperature on my thermostat and take a shower, which sends data to Eversource to tell them how much energy I have used and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/02/25/data-log-2-24-19/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Data log &#8211; 2/24/19</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Recently, I visited the Museum of Capitalism exhibit at SMFA. Among the pieces on display, there was an interactive sculpture titled &#8220;The Minimum Wage Machine&#8221;, which invited folks to crank a handle to churn out one penny every four seconds &#8211; or, $9/hour. Since the piece sits in a gallery within a university, I think the audience of this piece might be students, academics, and folks wanting (and able) to seek out art. Not everyone &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2019.datatherapy.org/2019/02/14/data-presentation-museum-of-capitalism/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Data presentation: museum of capitalism</span></a>]]></description>
